## Bitboards test project
This is a small project I worked on to learn to manipulate bits and to make some logic with bitboards. The goal was to implement all the needed functions and use them to make a small game prototype.

##Bit functions
I have gone over lots of different resources to learn what bit functions could be created and what are the use cases.  Under the hood, most of the functions are a combination of the basic bit operations.

The bit library is rigid and requires additional implementations to handle large numbers, but it is complete logic-wise and can be used for a small 8x8 board.

##Mini game

With the functions, I have decided to make a small game where you can plant trees on the tiles according to a set of rules. Later on, I implemented the ability to pick up trees and place them on other tiles and delete them.

My future plan is to make a similar project (or addition to this one) with basic math functions instead and a different mini-game prototype.
